# Misc Fixed Neue

## Background
The bitmap font Misc-Fixed 7x14 has been my terminal and coding font since 1995.
It is wonderful when it comes to clarity and readability even though it is more
condensed than many other fonts. 

I would keep using the same good old bitmap font if it wasn't for advancements
in technology that have made it harder and harder to use it. The first problem
is that many new IDEs do not support bitmap fonts. A more recent problems is that
the font becomes tiny on screens with very high resolution. Bitmap fonts do not
scale well.

After all years with this font I am so used to it that it is hard to adjust to
anything else. I have tried a large amount of monospaced programming fonts
during the years, but nothing beats the good old Misc-Fixed.

Some year ago I found a vectorized version of the font, done by Ulf Jordan
the year 2000. Ulf has made a great work vectorizing a good set of glyphs.
The result is a good step but visually it has some issues on modern screens.

This repo contains clean-ups and adjustments to make Misc-Fixed 7x14
shine again!
